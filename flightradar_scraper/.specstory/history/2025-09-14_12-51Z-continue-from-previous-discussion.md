bfb23daf-fbeb-49a7-a7f1-09e0584daa12 can you continueu from this?

_**Assistant**_

I can see you're referencing a specific ID, but I need to understand what you'd like me to continue from. Let me search for this ID in your codebase to understand the context.

The ID doesn't appear in your current codebase. Could you please clarify what you'd like me to continue from? For example:

1. Are you referring to a specific task or feature that was being worked on?
2. Is this related to a particular function or component in your flight radar scraper?
3. Are you looking to continue from a specific checkpoint or documentation file?

Looking at your project structure, I can see you have several checkpoint files and function-related documentation. Could you provide more context about what specific work you'd like me to continue with?
