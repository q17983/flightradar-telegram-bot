## 🛠️ Restore Commands

When you need to restore, say **"restore"** and I will:

1. Show you the last 10 checkpoints with names and descriptions
2. You choose which checkpoint to restore to
3. I will:
   - Reset git to that exact commit
   - Force push to trigger Railway redeployment

## 📋 Checkpoint Rules

**Before any major enhancement:**
1. Create new checkpoint with descriptive name
2. Document what's working and what's being changed
3. Test current state before proceeding
4. Make incremental changes with frequent commits

**Checkpoint naming convention:**
- `CHECKPOINT_XXX: "DESCRIPTIVE_NAME"`
- Examples: "ENHANCED_FUNCTION_1", "MULTI_FUNCTION_SUPPORT", "NEW_UI_FEATURES"

## 🎯 Next Enhancement Strategy

For future enhancements:
1. ✅ **Current state:** CHECKPOINT_001 working perfectly
2. 🔄 **Next:** Create CHECKPOINT_002 before any new features
3. 🚀 **Enhance:** Make incremental changes
4. 🧪 **Test:** Verify each step works
5. 💾 **Checkpoint:** Create new checkpoint when stable

**Remember:** Always test locally first, then deploy to Railway, then create checkpoint!
